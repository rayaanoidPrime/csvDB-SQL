<h1 align="center">CsvDB SQL</h1>
<p align="center">
A SQL database engine written in JavaScript.

</p>

This is the base repository for cohort members to follow the tutorial and send in their own StylusDB SQL implementations. Inspired by : https://github.com/ChakshuGautam/stylusdb-sql

> **Disclaimer**:
> This database is for educational purposes only. It is not intended for production use. It is written ground up in JavaScript and is a great way to learn how databases work. You can find the tutorial in the [docs](./docs) directory.

## Usage

```bash
const { executeSELECTQuery } = require('csvdb-sql');
const query = 'SELECT id, name FROM student WHERE age < 25';
const result = await executeSELECTQuery(query);
```

INSERT queries

```bash
const { executeINSERTquery } = require('csvdb-sql');
const insertQuery = "INSERT INTO grades (student_id, course, grade) VALUES ('4', 'Physics', 'A')";
await executeINSERTQuery(insertQuery);
```

DELETE queries

```bash
const {executeDELETEquery} = require('csvdb-sql');
const deleteQuery = "DELETE FROM courses WHERE course_id = '2'";
await executeDELETEQuery(deleteQuery);
```
